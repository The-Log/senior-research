\section{Progress}
\label{sec-2}
This start of this week, I finished up loss functions, learning about SoftMax and how it functions relative 
to Multiclass SVM Loss Functions. I also transitioned into implementing object detection in VizDoom and this is my
current progress in detecting general objects in Doom, but I have yet to implement a classifier over my 
Doom. You can see all the green boxes are signifant data that would be important to detect to play the game, such as your 
current weapon at hand, it detects health packs and ammo, and most enemies. \\
My hopes for next week is to implement a form of object detection like SSD.Pytorch or pytorch-yolo2 over this to framework
to complete the detection. Based on this detection, I also hope to have agent that is able to do basic actions based on
what it sees (shoot enemys, dodge fireballs, etc.). Then I would to move on to actual training.
